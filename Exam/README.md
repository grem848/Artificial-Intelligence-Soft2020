# Artificial Intelligence Exam Project | Fake and real news detector
 
##### Created by Andreas Guldborg Heick

## Objective
The objective of this task is to enable you to demonstrate the knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning acquired during the elective AI course.

The task is to create a machine learning based solution to a real life problem.


## Dataset Information
I chose the Fake and real news dataset from Kaggle, which is linked [here](https://datsoftlyngby.github.io/soft2020spring/resources/32351e43-ExamTask.pdf).


This Dataset is a collection of news stories including both fake and real news stories.
The assignment I have chosen to do is to create a model that can distinguish between fake news and real news based on the kaggle dataset. Since this is a dataset with known labels I am going to use Supervised Learning Models for my predictions.

## Classification or Regression
#### Classification
I chose to use classification because it predicts by putting some data into classes or categories. And I need to put a news story in either the category true or fake news.
This is what classification does, it tells us which discrete category our data fall into by predicting discrete values.

Classification uses a method of measuring accuracy.

#### Regression
Regression on the other hand predicts values like the height of a human or their age.
It is based on continuous values, meaning the values can be infinite and not countable.

Regression uses a method of measurement of root mean square error.

## WARNING: It takes quite some time to run all cells!
### Expect execution times of minimum 15 minutes
### Since everything is pickled I recommend just running the app.py file
#### How?
* Just type this in your prefered console or terminal
```
python app.py
```

* or run the last code cell of the project containing the command !python app.py
